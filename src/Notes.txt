NOTES:

# FUTURE INTEGRATION W/ GA:
> We maintain a set of alpha values in the ACO and use them to calculate the "goodness" of an edge. We then use the ACO
> to return discovered paths to the GA, which modifies the alpha values. The GA then returns new alpha values to the ACO.
> The process is repeated in parallel until convergence.
